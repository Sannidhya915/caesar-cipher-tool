This is a nifty web page that lets you play around with a classic encryption method called the Caesar Cipher. It's like a secret code generator!

##How to Use:

1. Enter Your Text:
    Just type in whatever text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the "Enter Text" box.

2. Choose a Shift:
    Use the "Enter Shift Value" box to set how much you want to shift the letters. It's like your secret decoder ring setting!

3. Encrypt or Decrypt:
    Click the "Encrypt" button, and voil√†, your text is transformed! Want to go back? Hit "Decrypt" with the same shift.
